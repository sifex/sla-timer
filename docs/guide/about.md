# Introduction

## ☑️ What is an SLA?

> A **service-level agreement** _(shortened to SLA)_ is a commitment between a service provider and a client. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user.

## ⏳ What is an SLA Timer?

An **SLA timer** is used to keep on top of things like "time-to-first-action", "time-to-resolution", and to gauge whether your commitments to customer responsiveness are being met. 

Examples of some time-based SLAs you can measure are:

1. Respond to all requests within 2 hours.
2. Resolve high-priority requests within 24 hours.
